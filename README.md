🧠 Early Prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Machine Learning
This repository contains the research and implementation details of our paper titled:
"Early Prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Machine Learning"
This research was conducted as a part of our Final Year Project - Phase 1 at Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT).

📄 Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early identification is crucial for timely intervention. In this study, we aimed to build an effective machine learning-based framework to predict the risk of ASD using behavioral and developmental data collected from children.

🎯 Objectives
Predict ASD at an early stage using questionnaire-based behavioral features.
Compare multiple machine learning algorithms for performance.
Identify key predictors contributing most to ASD diagnosis.
Enable data-driven support for early clinical screening.
📊 Dataset
Total Records: 200 children
100 diagnosed with ASD
100 neurotypical (non-ASD)
Data Source: Collected through structured questionnaires filled by parents/caregivers via Google Forms and supported by Autism Center Pakistan.
Features: 15 behavioral and developmental questions (categorical + range-based).
⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Label encoding for categorical values (Yes → 1, No → 0, Maybe → intermediate values).
Missing value imputation using mode.
Feature scaling via StandardScaler.
Feature selection using:
Chi-Square Test
Random Forest Feature Importance
🧪 Models Used
We evaluated multiple supervised ML models:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
AdaBoost
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
📈 Results
Model	Accuracy (%)
